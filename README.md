# GROUPOMANIA

"Groupomania" is the seventh project I worked on during my training with OpenClassrooms. In this scenario, I had to set up an internal social network. The aim of this tool was to facilitate interactions between colleagues in the fictitious company Groupomania.

I had to create both the backend and the frontend with the technology of my choice. There was no specification for the graphic charter, nor any mock-up provided.

So I chose :
- [x] Backend : Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize
- [x] Frontend : React, Bootstrap
